Docker Swarm : it is an orchestration service within Docker that allow us to manage and handle multiple conatiners at the same time. It is also a cluster of multipl conatiners

In Docker swarm one node or server is Manager Node and other are Worker Nodes 

manager node  : Manages the worker nodes, i.e, it defines tasks for every worker node.
worker nodes : execute the task assigned by the manager node.

(manager_node)creating a new swarm: docker swarm init --advertise-addr {manager_node_ip}
(worker_node)to join a swarm: we need to execute a token produced by the manager node to join the swarm as worker node
(worker_node)to leave the swarm : docker swarm leave
(manager_node)to close a swarm: docker swarm leave --force
to change the availability : docker node udate --availability {node_id}
