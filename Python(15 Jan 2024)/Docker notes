Docker : It is a open source tha helps to develop, build, deploy and execute a software independently. It deos so by creating containers

Container : Container basically works as a packages that bundles a code with environment, runtime libraries, dependencies and all other utils to exceute the code into a single deployable unit. It runs as an isolated process, it has its own file system, network and process space

Docker Environment : 1. Docker Engine
		     2. Docker Object
		     3. Docker Registry
		     4. Docker Compose
		     5. Docker Swarm

1.--> Handles the creation and management of all the docker processes
contains 3 major parts Docker CLI, Docker API, Docker Deamon

2.--> It contain Docker images, container, volumes, networks, etc

Docker Image : Are set of instruction to create containers

to run a docker image : docker run -it -d {imageName}(-it : interactive, -d : run in background)
to go inside a container : docker exec -ti {containername} bash 
remove a container : docker rm {container_id}
remove a image: docker rmi {image_id}
to go inside a container: docker exec -ti {container_id} bash
how to puul a image: docker pull {image_name}
to stop a container : docker stop {container_id}
to see all the available images : docker images



Docker Object--volumes  : these are storage for conatiners

Docker Object--Network : connection between one or more containers

3.--> it is the place were we can store our docker images

4.--> it is a docker service that enable us launch multiple container at the same time

5.--> it allow us to manage multiple containers

Docker file: these basically are the scripts that you can write and then build into a image, then that image can be run to create container

Docker file instructions:
FROM
WORKDIR
ADD
COPY
RUN
CMD
LABEL
